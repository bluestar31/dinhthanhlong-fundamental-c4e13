- How to check variable's type?
-> Answer:
	+ We can identify strings if they are enclosed in quotation marks.
	+ Or we can use a function of Python called "type" which can tell us "what's variable's type?" if we're not sure.
		For example:
			>>> type("I'm very handsome!")
			<class 'str'>
				-> so this is a string variable.
			>>> type(17)
			<class 'int'>
				-> so this is a integer variable.

-In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
-> Answer:
	We will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling us that some of our variables have invalid names in some cases such as:
		+ We begin variable names with a digit.
		+ We defined variable names which contains an illegal character (like $, %, ^, ...).
		+ We defined variable names same as Python keywords.

	3 Examples of invalid names:
		+ 31bluestar
			-> Begin with digits "31".
		+ chicken^age 
			-> Contains "^" which is an illegal character.
		+ for
			-> "for" is the Python keyword.
